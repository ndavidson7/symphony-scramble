# Symphony Scramble

Symphony Scramble brings the very music we love to life! You are immersed in a unique rhythmic challenge, climbing through obstacles to escape the curse of the evil Dr. Music. As you climb upwards and through the scrolling platform environment of instruments like the Djimbe and Trumpet, it is up to you to get into the rhythmic groove to best escape the challenges before you and avoid Dr. Music’s hoards of treacherous goons. The decaying music and magic obstacles create a one-of-a-kind immersive challenge that forces you to keep the song alive, receive the highest score, and secure freedom from Dr. Music’s clutches.

## Instructions:
The player character is controlled with W, A, S, and D, as is traditional for computer platformers. The goal is to reach the end of the level, marked with a checkered flag, by overcoming obstacles and jumping from platform to platform. Some platforms move around, some decay over time after being used, and some bounce you upwards. The song that plays has a certain level of health, which is slowly decreasing. To keep the song alive, you must secure music note collectibles (which also increases your score!) while keeping your own health alive by avoiding enemies. If the song ends, or you run out of health, the game is over!

## Available Content:
There are two levels, one of which is modeled after the inside of a trumpet while the other is modeled after the inside of a drum. There are three difficulty levels, which make the game harder by increasing enemy speed and damage, decreasing your health, and increasing song health decay rate. There is also a system to save your high score.
